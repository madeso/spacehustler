Delerium
=======

Delerium is a basic modern opengl rendering engine. I only does rendering. It does not play sounds, it does not load models, shaders or textures. It doesn't even create the area to be rendered upon. That is up to you.

It is also not complete.

Currently supported platforms:
=======

* Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010
* Fedora 17, KDevelop 4.4.1
