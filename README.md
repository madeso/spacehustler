Euphoria
=======

Euphoria is a basic modern opengl data driven game and rendering engine. It is not complete.

Stuff that I'd like to add:
=======
* add loading of meshes (assimp)
* add entity system with basic components
* add scripting support (lua)
* add physics system (ode, tokamak, physx, bullet)
* add a global tweak system (Anttweakbar)
* add loading of shaders from files with preprocessor
* audio and music support
* menu support (ce gui)
* hud/2d support
* lights and shaddows
* particle systems
* godrays
* panning materials
* normal + specular + glow map
* material templates with optional (lua) script
* culling + world editor
* replace filehandling with a vfs
* deffered rendering
* hdr
* possible support older systems

Currently supported platforms:
=======

* Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010
* Fedora 17, KDevelop 4.4.1
